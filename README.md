# Gross Domestic Product (USA) - d3.js

## A Free Code Camp Data Visualisation Project

### Objective:

Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart).

### User Stories:

* I can see US Gross Domestic Product by quarter, over time.
* I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the GDP amount and exact year and month that bar represents.
